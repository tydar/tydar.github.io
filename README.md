# Personal website

This is my personal website. I'm using it as a place to work on developing from scratch in React, without using any
UI frameworks or toolkits. The site is built using Gatsby 2.0 & JSS for styling. If you go to the live site, you can see some of my
next steps & ideas for the site by navigating throught the 'Work' page to the project page for this site.

If you want to get a copy of this running locally, for whatever reason, first install [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), then clone
this repo, then run `gatsby develop` and you should be off to the races.
