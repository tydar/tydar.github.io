The site you're on. <!-- end -->

I built this site to tinker with designing *without* a UI framework (so you can expect it to evolve over time). I also learned how to use gatsby to develop
React-based static sites, which I'm using now for some quick fun projects at work and for family.

Here's my list of issues for this site:
* Convert all functions to arrow notation
* Settle on a color scheme *DONE*
* Make the 'Work' page responsive *DONE*
* Clean up the configuration
* Add PropTypes declarations for all components
* Add unit tests (at least for components with actual logic)
